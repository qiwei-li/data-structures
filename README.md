* __bags__

 This program simulates the actions of luggage handling for a large aircraft. Luggage is loaded into containers as the luggage arrives. When a container is full, or there is no more luggage, it is loaded into the aircraft. At the destination, the containers are unloaded with the last on being the first off.

 _timetest.cpp_ will compare the speed of different operations of searching, inserting, and deleting with the following data structures.
    * Linked List
    * Cursor List
    * Stack Array
    * Stack List
    * Queue Array
    * Skip List
